= Substrate Runtime Toolbox: srtool

== Intro

NOTE: This is a fork of https://gitlab.com/chevdor[chevdor]'s tool, which can be found https://gitlab.com/chevdor/srtool[here]

srtool is a collection of dockerized tools helping with https://substrate.dev[Substrate] & https://polkadot.network[Polkadot] Runtime development.

It especially helps with building and verifying Wasm Runtime Blobs. 
  
The Docker image is `{name}`. You can find it at https://hub.docker.com/r/{name}.

== Install

=== Pull image

[subs="attributes+"]
----
    docker pull {name}:<version> # <1>
----

<1> where `<version>` is the rustc version you want to use.

...or just skip that step, the right image will be fetched at first run.

=== Using an alias    

Creating an alias helps hiding the docker complexity behind one simple command. We will see more powerful options but this one is simple enough.

[subs="attributes+"]
----
    export RUSTC_VERSION={rsversion}; export PACKAGE=kusama-runtime; alias srtool='docker run --rm -it -e PACKAGE=$PACKAGE -v $PWD:/build -v /tmp/cargo:/cargo-home {name}:$RUSTC_VERSION'
----

NOTE: Note that defining the alias as done above will hardcode the runtime. Using `kusama-runtime` as show above means you will *always* check the kusama runtime. If you need more, check the next chapter. 

NOTE: If you want to check what your alias is, use `type srtool`

The command to invoke a build will then be `srtool build`.

=== Power users

If you want flexibility, using a *function* is slightly more complex but more flexible.

If you already defined an alias (you can check with `type srtool`), you should first unset it with `unlias srtool`.

NOTE: You cannot use both an alias and a function but you could make a function called fsrtool for instance for the function... 

==== Hardcoded compiler version

This option should be enough most of the time.

[subs="attributes+"]
----
    function srtool() { docker run --rm -it -e PACKAGE=$1 -v $PWD:/build -v /tmp/cargo:/cargo-home {name}:{rsversion} $2; }
----

The commands to use srtool are then:

[subs="attributes+"]
----
    srtool kusama-runtime build
----

NOTE: The <kusama-runtime> keyword above specifies we will check the kusama runtime. If your runtime is called xyz-runtime, swap accordingly.

==== Parametric compiler version

Using this version is more powerful if you know what you are doing but also requires more typing.

[subs="attributes+"]
----
    function srtool() { docker run --rm -it -e PACKAGE=$1 -v $PWD:/build -v /tmp/cargo:/cargo-home {name}:$2 $3; }
----

The command to invoke a build will then be `srtool <package> <rust_version> build`. For instance:

[subs="attributes+"]
----
    srtool my-super-runtime {rsversion} build
    srtool polkadot-runtime nightly-2019-12-05 build
----

WRNING: The second example is only there to illustrate how it works. If you try it today, it will likely *not* work as I did not build a container for this version yet.

You likely want to make this persistent with:

[subs="attributes+"]
----
    echo "export RUSTC_VERSION={rsversion}; export PACKAGE=polkadot-runtime; alias srtool='docker run --rm -it -e PACKAGE=$PACKAGE -v $PWD:/build -v /tmp/cargo:/cargo-home {name}:$RUSTC_VERSION'" >> ~/.bash_profile && source ~/.bash_profile
----

If you wish to see more (it takes a little longer), you may set the `VERBOSE` ENV variable:

[subs="attributes+"]
----
    export RUSTC_VERSION={rsversion}; export PACKAGE=polkadot-runtime; alias srtool='docker run --rm -it -e PACKAGE=$PACKAGE -e VERBOSE=1 -v $PWD:/build -v /tmp/cargo:/cargo-home {name}:$RUSTC_VERSION'
----

NOTE: The part `-v /tmp/cargo:/cargo-home` exposes the docker container's cargo cache on your local machine. This helps making subsequent builds faster.

== Use

Now that you defined the srtool alias, you can use it as shown below:

.See the help
    srtool help

.Build the runtime
    srtool build

.Typical run

Invoking `srtool build` with:

    $ srtool build

Will output something that looks like this:

.JSON output
If you prefer a json output, srtool has you covered:

    $ srtool build --json

Will give you such an output:

== Troubleshooting

=== Outdated repo

If you run into issues while running `srtool`, make sure you are using a decently recent version of Polkadot/Substrate:

Then run the following commands:

    rm -rf target/srtool
    cargo clean
    cargo update

You can now try running `srtool build` again.

=== `srtool` tells me the folder is not a cargo project

The error is probably: `!!! The folder on your host computer does not look like a Cargo project. Are you really in your repo?``

Run the following command:

    alias srtool

And make sure that you see `$PWD:/build/` and not `/home/your_name/:/build`.
If you are running into this issue, your `.bash_profile` likely contains double quotes (") where you should have used single ones (').

=== Other cases

If you still run into troubles, please open a new issue and describe the error you see and the steps you took. 

== Proposal field

What is important in the output of srtool is the `Proposal` field:

[subs="attributes+"]
----
    üß∞ Substrate Runtime Toolbox üß∞
    ... Bla bla ...
    Proposal : 0x5931690e71e9d3d9f04a43d8c15e45e0968e563858dd87ad6485b2368a286a8f
    ... more blabla ...
----

The `Proposal` field value should should match the value of the proposal you can see in the Polkadot UI.

.Advanced usage
if you feel fancy, you may also run:

    srtool bash

and look around the `/srtool` folder

== ZSH/ Zinit users

If you are using `zsh` and `zinit`, you may benefit from using the srtool snippet I am maintaining.

To do so, add the following to your `zshconfig`:

```
MY_REPO="https://gitlab.com/chevdor/dotfiles/-/raw/master/zsh-plugins"
for plugin (git cargo srtool); { <1> 
  SNIPPET="$MY_REPO/$plugin/$plugin.plugin.zsh"
  zinit snippet $SNIPPET
}
```
<1> Chose the snippets you want, the one called `srtool` here is the interesting one.

After that, make sure to:
- upgrade your snippets: `zplugin update --all`
- restart/source your shell: `. ~/.zshrc`

== Build the Docker image

While you don't have to build the image yourself, you still may!

First you may want to double check what rustc versions are available as you will HAVE to build an image for a given version:

    rustup check

So say you want to build a builder for rustc {rsversion}:

[subs="attributes+"]
----
    RUSTC_VERSION={rsversion} && docker build --build-arg RUSTC_VERSION=$RUSTC_VERSION -t {name}:$RUSTC_VERSION .
----

== Scripts

You can see the list of available scripts in the `/scripts` folder:

- `help`: Show some help
- `version`: Show some version. *DEPRECATED*: use `info` instead
- `info`: Show systems infos and version
- `build`: Run the actual build

NOTE: The `info` and `version` scripts pass any arguments you pass to the script to `jq`. So you can play with `c` (compact), `-M`(monochrome), `-C` color output. For instance `docker run --rm -it -v $PWD:/build chevdor/srtool:nightly-2021-02-25 info -cM` shows a monochrome output on a single line.
